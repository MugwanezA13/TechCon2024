        <p>TechCon, a premier event for technology enthusiasts, has its roots in the early <br>
             days of personal computing. It began as a small gathering of hobbyists who shared <br>
             a passion for technology and wanted to learn from each other. Over the years, TechCon <br>
             has evolved into a major conference that attracts thousands of attendees from all over the world.</p><br>

        <p>In the 1970s, as personal computers were becoming more affordable, a group of <br>
             enthusiasts in Silicon Valley began to meet regularly to discuss the latest <br>
             developments in technology. These gatherings were informal and often took place <br>
             in people's homes or garages. As the group grew, they decided to organize a larger <br>
             event to share their knowledge with a wider audience.</p>
